# Travel Fare Calculator 🗺️ 🧳
This program is an assignment for [Patika.dev](https://patika.dev) and allows users to determine their travel fare by inputting the journey distance in kilometers, their age, and choosing between a one-way or round-trip option. Based on these entries, the program calculates the fare, applying age-related discounts for users under 12 or between 12 and 24 years old, as well as for those over 65. Additionally, it offers a 20% discount for round-trip journeys. Upon input validation, the app provides the total fare; otherwise, it prompts the user with an error message.
